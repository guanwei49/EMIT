            "missing parts": "<Missing Parts Defect>\n Description: The \"missing parts\" defect in an on/off switch, like the one shown, specifically refers to the absence or loss of some of its structural components that are crucial for its operation or structural integrity. To identify this kind of defect in similar switches, you should look for the following visual characteristics:  1. **Incomplete Appearance**: Check if the switch lacks any parts that are generally visible in a fully intact switch. This might include missing cover plates, buttons, or connectors.  2. **Exposed Internal Components**: If internal components such as wiring, metal contacts, or plastic supports, which are typically concealed, are visible, this may indicate that external parts of the switch are missing.  3. **Non-functional Movement**: Often, when parts are missing, the switch may not operate smoothly or may not function at all. For instance, a slider or button might not stay in place or lacks the resistance it normally has with all parts intact.  4. **Loose Parts**: If the switch feels unusually loose or parts seem to move without the typical constraints, it might suggest that securing components like screws or frames are missing.  5. **Gaps or Holes**: Visible gaps or holes where parts should be present are a clear indication of missing pieces. These are spots where typically no light should pass through or be visible.  By recognizing these characteristics, you can identify if an on/off type switch in other images or in practical scenarios exhibits a \"missing parts\" defect.",

It could be deeper or merely superficial, but it clearly contrasts with the surrounding area.  3. **Color and Texture Contrast**: The scratch usually exhibits a different color or shade compared to the rest of the switch, often lighter because it exposes the material beneath the top coating. The surrounding area might still maintain its original color and glossiness, making the scratch more distinctive.  4. **Length and Direction**: Scratches can vary in length from very short to almost spanning the entire visible area of the switch's surface. They can run straight, diagonal, or have a slightly jagged direction depending on the cause of the scratch.  5. **Visibility**: Depending on the angle of light and the color of the switch, scratches might sometimes only be visible under certain lighting conditions or viewing angles due to light reflecting differently off the disrupted surface compared to the intact area.  Using these details, it becomes easier to scrutinize similar switches in other images for similar defects, thereby enabling effective identification and assessment of the switch's condition.",
            "contamination": "<Contamination Defect>\n Description: The \"contamination\" defect on a switch like the one shown can be described as follows:  1. **Appearance**: Contamination frequently appears as an unusual spot or area with a noticeably different color or texture compared to the rest of the switch's surface. In this case, look for areas that might have a distinct coloration that does not match the standard coloring of either the switch body or its button.  2. **Location**: While contamination can occur anywhere on the switch, common areas include around the edges of the button, on the button itself, or on the body surrounding the button. These are areas where dirt, debris, or foreign substances might accumulate or adhere.  3. **Texture and Consistency**: A contamination defect may alter the texture, making the contaminated area rougher or stickier than the unaffected areas. This may be visible as a matte or glossy finish on an otherwise uniformly textured area.  4. **Size**: The size of the contamination can vary. It may be a tiny spec or a larger blotch.

The teeth align opposite each other and a slider, also known as a zip slider, moves along the rows to engage or disengage the teeth, effectively opening or closing an opening. Zippers are commonly used as fastening devices in clothing, bags, and other items, providing a simple, reliable method to secure openings. Essential characteristics of zippers include their material composition, which can vary from metal like steel or brass to synthetic polymers like nylon or polyester; the configuration of their teeth, which can be designed for specific strength and alignment requirements; and the robustness and design of the slider, which plays a crucial role in the zipper's functionality and durability."
