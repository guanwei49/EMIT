The object in the query image is an oval-shaped pill with embossed capital letters "FF" in the center. The pill appears to have a white or off-white base color, with small, reddish-brown speckles distributed throughout its surface. These speckles are most likely an inherent part of the pill design and do not indicate any defect.

Upon close inspection, there does not appear to be any significant anomaly or defect present on the pill. The embossed letters are clear and well-defined, with no evident smudging, misprinting, or deformation. The edges of the pill are smooth and well-formed, without any chips or irregularities. The surface texture, while speckled with intentional discolorations as part of its design, does not show any scratches, dents, or imperfections that would suggest a defect.

Considering the normal pattern of the object, as visible on the provided template image, which includes similar speckles and embossed letters, the query image adheres to these characteristics. The speckles are part of the normal appearance and not regarded as defects because they are consistent and evenly distributed, suggesting they are a deliberate part of the pill's composition rather than accidental damage or contamination.

In summary, the pill in the query image shows no signs of defects or anomalies and matches the expected normal pattern for this type of product.
