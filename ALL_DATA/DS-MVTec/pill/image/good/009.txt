The object in the image is an oval-shaped pill with the letters "FF" embossed in the center. The pill has speckled red particulate matter distributed throughout its surface, which appears to be an intentional characteristic of the pill's design rather than a defect. This speckled pattern is consistent with the provided template normal image, suggesting that the appearance of these red specks is a normal feature of this type of pill.

There are no apparent defects or anomalies visible on this pill. The embossed letters are clear and well-defined without any smudging or irregularities, and the pill's edges are smooth and well-formed. The overall shape of the pill is uniform and symmetrical.

The pillâ€™s red particulates could be mistaken for defects if one is not familiar with the intended design, but in this case, they are part of the pill's standard appearance and should not be considered defects or anomalies. In summary, the pill appears to be normal and free of any defects based on the image provided.
