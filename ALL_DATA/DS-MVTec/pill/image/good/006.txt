The object in the image appears to be an oval-shaped pill with an embossed double "F" on its upper surface. The pill has a general white background with small pinkish or reddish speckles distributed across its surface. It is set against a dark background, which provides a high-contrast view that emphasizes the features of the pill.

Upon careful inspection, there does not appear to be any obvious defects or anomalies present on the pill. The embossed "F" characters are clear and well-defined, with no signs of smudging or incomplete imprinting. The pill's speckles are part of its normal pattern; they are scattered in a random fashion and seem to be a characteristic of the pill's design, indicating that they are an intended feature rather than a defect.

The overall quality of the pill appears to be consistent with a normal product, without observable defects in the provided image. The random pattern of speckles is part of the pill's design and not considered a defect, as long as the distribution does not affect the pill's integrity or identification.
