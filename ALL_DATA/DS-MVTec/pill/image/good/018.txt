1. The object in the image appears to be an oval-shaped pill with the letters "FF" imprinted in the center. It has a white background with small reddish-brown speckles distributed throughout its surface.
2. There does not seem to be any defect or anomaly present on the pill based on the comparison with the template normal image provided.
3. The normal pattern of the object includes the consistent imprint of the letters "FF" and the scattered reddish-brown speckles. These speckles are not considered defects as they are uniform in appearance across the different reference images and seem to be part of the pill's design. The consistency of the imprint and the speckle pattern across the normal images suggests that they are inherent features of the pill and not imperfections. The edges and surface of the pill look smooth and free from chipping or damage, which further indicates that the pill is normal without any observable defects.
