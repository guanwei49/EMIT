The object in the image appears to be a pill, oval in shape and white in color. It is imprinted with the letters "FF" in the center. The pill contains speckled red-brown inclusions uniformly distributed throughout its surface, which appear to be a characteristic of the pill's formulation rather than defects or anomalies.

Upon closer inspection, there are no visible major defects such as chips, cracks, or deformation on the pill. The edges are smooth and well-defined, and the imprinted letters are clear and properly formed. The overall shape is consistent with the common design of orally administered pills.

Given this observation and the notably consistent appearance of the speckles on the pill's surface, it can be concluded that the pill displayed fits within the expected normal pattern and does not exhibit any defects or anomalies. The red-brown speckles are considered part of the pill's normal characteristics and are not deemed defects.
