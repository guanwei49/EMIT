The object in the image is an oval-shaped pill with an imprint of the letters "FF" in the center. The pill has a white base color and is speckled with small red spots dispersed across its surface. 

Upon inspection of the query image, there does not appear to be any obvious defect or anomaly on the pill when compared to the template normal image. The red speckles are consistent with the normal pattern, and there is no evident damage, discoloration, cracking, or misshaping that would indicate a defect.

The red speckles, while they might look like irregularities, are part of the design of the pill and are not considered defects. They are consistently present across the normal and query images, indicating these are a feature of this particular pill and not a product flaw. 

Overall, the query image appears to depict a normal pill that matches the expected pattern displayed in the template normal image, with no detectable defects upon this visual inspection.
