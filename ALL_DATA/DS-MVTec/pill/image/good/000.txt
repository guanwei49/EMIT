The object in the image appears to be an oval-shaped pill with a smooth surface. It is predominantly white with small red specks distributed throughout. Embossed in the center of the pill are the capital letters "FF", which are prominent and appear to be part of the pill's design.

Upon inspecting the pill for defects or anomalies, I do not observe any deviations from the expected pattern or appearance when compared to the provided template normal image. The pill in the query image retains the general characteristics of the template, with consistent coloring, shape, and letter embossing. There are no visible cracks, chips, or discolorations that would suggest a defect. The normal pattern of the object is an evenly shaped oval pill with a smooth surface, uniform color with red specks, and clear, well-defined embossed letters.

Summarizing, the object in the query image is consistent with the template normal image, and there are no apparent defects or anomalies on its surface.
