The object in the image appears to be an oval-shaped pill with the letters "FF" embossed in the center. The pill has a white base color and is speckled with tiny red dots distributed across its surface.

Upon inspection, there does not seem to be any visible defect or anomaly on the pill when compared to the template image provided. The embossed letters are clearly defined and centered, the red speckles seem to be part of the pill's design and are evenly distributed, and there are no obvious chips, cracks, or deformities.

The normal pattern of the pill is consistent with what is shown in the query image: an oval shape with "FF" engraved in the middle, and a speckled pattern of red dots on a white background.
