The object in the image appears to be an oval-shaped pill, primarily white in color with some small reddish-brown speckles distributed throughout its surface. It has the letters "F F" engraved or embossed in the center. The image background is solid black, which accentuates the pill's outline and coloration.

Upon inspecting the pill against the provided template normal image, there does not seem to be any noticeable defects or anomalies on the pill surface or the embossing of the letters "F F". The edges are smooth, and the engraving is consistent and clear. The reddish-brown speckles are part of the pill's normal pattern and are scattered irregularly across its surface, as observed in the reference template as well.

The pill appears to adhere to the expected characteristics of its kind without any visible defects.
