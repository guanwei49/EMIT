The object in the image is an oval-shaped pill with a speckled pattern and embossed with the letters "FF." There are numerous small reddish-brown speckles distributed across the surface of the pill. This pattern is typical for medication that might have a speckled design for identification or aesthetic reasons.

There does not appear to be any obvious defects or anomalies present on the pill when comparing it to the normal pattern shown in the template images. The pill retains the common characteristics such as its oval shape, the presence of the "FF" imprint centered on the pill, and the same speckled design across its surface. Based on the comparison, the pill does not show any significant deviation from the normal appearance, with consistent coloration, and no visible damage or irregularities on its surface.
