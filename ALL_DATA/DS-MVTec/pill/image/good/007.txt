The object in the image appears to be an oval-shaped pill with the imprint "FF" on its surface. The pill has a white background with small, red speckles distributed throughout its material. Upon inspection of the pill in the query image:

1. Simple description: The pill is oval, with a raised "FF" imprint in the center. Its surface seems smooth, and it has a consistent white color with red speckles evenly dispersed.

2. Defect/Anomaly presence: There appears to be no defect or anomaly on the pill when compared to the template normal image. 

3. Defect/Anomaly description: Not applicable, as there is no observable defect.

Normal pattern summary: The normal pattern of the pill includes the clear, legible "FF" imprint, consistent coloration of the white background, and the randomly distributed red speckles. These speckles are not considered defects or anomalies as they are present in all the reference images provided and seem to be part of the pill's design. The edges of the pill appear to be well-defined without chipping, and the overall shape is uniform, indicating that the pill meets the expected quality standards.

Noise features: The speckles might be considered noise in certain contexts, but in this case, they are a consistent feature across all example images and do not indicate a quality issue with the product. Any minor variations in the speckle pattern are not impacting the pill's integrity and are therefore not classified
