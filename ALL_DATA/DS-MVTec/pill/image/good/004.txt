The object in the image appears to be an oval-shaped, white pill with the imprint "FF" on its surface. The pill is speckled with small red or pinkish spots distributed sporadically across its entire surface, which appears to be a characteristic of the pill's design rather than a defect.

Upon examining the speckles, they seem to be consistent with the design of the pill in the template normal image, which also shows a similar pattern of red or pinkish speckles. There is no evidence of any significant anomalies or defects such as chips, cracks, discoloration distinct from the speckled pattern, or deformation of the pill shape or imprint that would indicate a problem with the pill.

In summary, the pill appears to conform to the expected pattern that includes the "FF" imprint and characteristic speckles, and there are no apparent defects or anomalies that would cause concern for a product defect. The speckles are considered part of the normal design and not defects.
